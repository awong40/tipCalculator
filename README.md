# tipCalculator

HOW MANY HOURS DID THIS TAKE?
This took me 5 hours to complete.

WHICH REQUIRED AND OPTIONAL STORIES HAVE YOU COMPLETED?
I have included areas where the user can enter in the bill
amount and see the tip value as well as the total bill value. 
I have included custom segmented control tabs so that the user
can choose between 3 different tip percentages as well as 
change the amount of people in the party. I have also added 
the ability for the user to divy up the bill amongst a set amount
of people, ranging from 1 to 6. I also added images and color to
make things look a bit nicer.
